                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are primates that belong to the suborder Haplorhini. They are known for their agility, intelligence, and diverse range of species.</p>
                <p>Monkeys come in various shapes, sizes, and colors. They have long tails, flexible limbs, and grasping hands that allow them to climb, swing, and move through trees with great ease.</p>
                <p>These playful creatures are highly social and live in groups called troops or bands. Troops can range in size from a few individuals to several dozen members, depending on the species. They communicate with each other using a combination of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Just before the monkey tail.</p>
