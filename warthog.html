                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in Africa. They are known for their distinctive appearance, characterized by their tusks and wart-like protrusions on their faces.</p>
                <p>Warthogs have a sturdy and compact build, with males being larger than females. They have a bristly coat that helps protect them from the elements and a mane of longer hair along their spines.</p>
                <p>These omnivorous animals feed on a variety of vegetation, including grass, roots, berries, and even small animals. They are well-adapted to digging, with their elongated snouts and powerful front teeth.</p>
                <p>Warthogs are diurnal and often live in family groups called sounders. They are known for their defensive behavior, where they can use their tusks to ward off predators or fight among themselves for dominance.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Warthogs are found in various habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, including grasslands, savannas, and woodlands. They are particularly common in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.</p>
