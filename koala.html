                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are arboreal herbivorous marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their unique appearance and their fondness for eucalyptus leaves.</p>
                <p>Koalas have a stout and compact body with a large head and round ears. They have thick gray fur, which helps protect them from the harsh Australian climate. Their diet consists almost entirely of eucalyptus leaves, which provide them with the necessary nutrients and water.</p>
                <p>These adorable creatures spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees and are well-adapted for a life in the treetops. They have strong limbs and sharp claws, which allow them to climb and grip tree branches with ease.</p>
                <p>Koalas are known for their calm and docile nature. They spend a significant amount of their time sleeping, often curled up in the forks of trees. They are also solitary animals, with each koala occupying its own territory.</p>
