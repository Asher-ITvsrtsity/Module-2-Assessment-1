                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. They are the largest living primates and belong to the genus Gorilla.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are known for their strength and are often considered gentle giants. They have a large and muscular build, with males being significantly larger than females. Adult males, called silverbacks, can weigh up to 400 pounds (180 kilograms) and stand over 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) tall when upright.</p>
                <p>Gorillas are social animals that live in groups called troops or bands. A troop typically consists of one dominant silverback, several adult females, and their offspring. The silverback is the leader and protector of the group.</p>
                <p>These fascinating creatures primarily feed on vegetation, including leaves, stems, fruits, and shoots. They have a specialized digestive system that allows them to extract nutrients from fibrous plant material.</p>
