                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>Pandas are large, bear-like mammals known for their distinctive black and white markings. They are native to China and are considered national treasures.</p>
                <p>These adorable creatures primarily feed on bamboo, which makes up 99% of their diet. Pandas have a specialized thumb-like wrist bone, which helps them grasp bamboo stalks. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have a digestive system similar to that of herbivores.</p>
                <p>Pandas have a peaceful and gentle demeanor. They spend most of their time eating and sleeping. Due to their low-calorie diet, they have a relatively low energy level and prefer to conserve their energy.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, pandas are an endangered species, with a small population remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitat and ensure their survival.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>In the panda pen, located near the fountain.</p>
