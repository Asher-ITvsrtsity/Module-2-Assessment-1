                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>Lions are large, carnivorous mammals belonging to the cat family, Felidae. They are known for their majestic appearance, impressive manes (in males), and powerful roars.</p>
                <p>Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their offspring, and a few dominant males. The male lions, known as "lions," are recognized by their impressive manes.</p>
                <p>These apex predators are skilled hunters and primarily feed on large ungulates, such as zebras, wildebeests, and antelopes. The females of the pride are usually the primary hunters, while the males defend the territory and protect the pride.</p>
                <p>Lions are known for their strong bonds within the pride, and they often engage in social behaviors such as grooming, rubbing heads, and nuzzling. They communicate through various vocalizations, including roars, growls, and grunts.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>At the Lion pen near Mo's Pizza.</p>
